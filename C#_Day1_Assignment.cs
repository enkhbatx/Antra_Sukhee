// Introduction to C# and data Types
// UNderstanding data types 
/* 1. int
 * 2. double 
 * 3. int
 * 4. string
 * 5. decimal
 * 6. float
 * 7. float
 * 8. decimal
 * 9. double 
 * 10. int
 * 11. int
 * 12. int
 * 
 */


/* 2. Value types will directly hold the value, while reference types will hold memory address or reference for the value 
 * boxing: is converting value type to reference tpye
 * unboxing is converting reference type to value type
 * 
 * 
 */


/* 
 * 3. Managed resources are those that are pure . NET code and managed by the runtime and are under its direct control. 
 * Unmanaged resources are those that are not.
 * 
 */


/* 4. Garbage collector allocates memory of the application 
 */


/* Control Flow and converting types
 * 1. there will be build error 
 * 2. build error
 * 3. You get an error
 * 4. y++ first execute then increment the value. ++y increments value then executes the statement 
 * 5. break - ends the loop. continue - starts the next iteration. return - is used to return a value from a function; I have never used return in a loop. 
 * 6. the initialization, the condition, and the advancement to the next iteration. The initialization and the condition are required.
 * 7. = assigns value to a variable. == campares values and return boolena value. 
 * 8.no
 * 9. _ replaces the default keyword to signify that it should match anythign if reached
 * 10. IEnumerable permits enumeration by using a foreach loop.
 * 11.

/* Arrays and Strings 
 * test knowledge 
 * 1. if sting will remain constant then we cna use String, if not we use StringBuilder.
 * 2.The Array class is the base class for all arrays 
 * 3. using Array.Sort() method
 * 4.Length of the array 
 * 5. We cannot store multiple data types to array.
 * 6. CopyTo() copies array in to another existing array. Clone() creates a new array (a copy).
 * 7.
