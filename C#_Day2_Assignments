/* 1. the six different types of access modifiers are 
 *  - Public : makes object accessible from everywhere in project
 *  - Private : object accessible inside a class.
 *  - Protected : onject is accessible inside the class nad in all classes that derive from the class 
 *  - Internal : object access is limited excusively to classes defined withing the current project assembly 
 *  - Protected Interal : we can only access the object in same project assembly or in a derived class in other assemblies
 *  - Private Protected : we can access members inside the containing class or in a class that derives from a containing class, but only in the same project assembly.

/* 2. const is initialized at compile time, 
 * - readonly keyword allow the variable to be initialized either at compile time or runtime
 *  
 * 
 */

/*  3. constructor initialized a newly created object of class. 
 * 
 */


/*  4. Partial keywords indicate that other parts of the class can be defined in the namespace. 
 *  - this allows multiple developers to work simultaneously in the same calss in defferent files. 
 *  
 */

/*  5. Tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types.
 * 
 */


/* 6. C# record keyword is used to define a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data
 * 
 */

/* 7. Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name 
 *   but different parameters.
 *   - Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters. 
 * 
 */


/* 8. Field is a variable of any type that is declared directly in a class.
 *  - Property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the value of a private field.
 * 
 */


/* 9. We can make a parameter optional by assigning default for that parameter. 
 * 
 */


/* 10. Abstract class allows us to make functions taht sublclasses can implement or override.
 *   - interface only permits us to state functionality but not to implement it.
